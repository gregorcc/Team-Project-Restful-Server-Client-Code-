Please only look at backendInterface.kt file for communicating with Backend. 
You will find basic esentials function call over there NOT IN ANY OTHER FILE.

If you are unsure of Interfaces,then to make use of the BackEnd File - "backendInterface.kt", try this in you code:

val backEnd = backendInterface
//Now use this variable to get function calls according to your necessity.
//For example: 
//  backEnd.createUser(Profile(user: User): String 
//  this should return a string saying if it's successful or not.

//If you want any information whatever you have done so far to be saved for future please make sure to add the following command:

backEnd.shutdown()

//without these command the backEnd is not responsible for saving you responses or user Data or Survey Questions.

NOTE: The dataBase is set to have no information whatsoever when you download this repo. So first thing to do is create an user, 
        create survey questions, try logging in an user and then try adding responses. After you done running your code you MUST 
        CALL backEndInterface.shutdown() TO SAVE YOUR WORK OR PROGRESS

Now, since we are usingle SINGLETON to reduce multiple read and write commands to the database, 
    we need to change our compile time constants. Basically don't create another instance of class backendInterface because 
    your compiler will not initialize the private variables again. Rather it will use the previous object's refernce.

ALSO PASTE THE FOLLOWING IN GRADLE:
//Gradle
//compile group: 'org.apache.commons', name: 'commons-email', version: '1.1'
