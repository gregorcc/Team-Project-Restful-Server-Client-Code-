Here is the original code for the group project backend, I am responsible for writing the server code in the file Server.kt and
NetworkResponse.kt, these files are located within src/main, other files were implemented by another team member who was
responsible for creating the database. An API was provided for me by this team member so that I may process requests that came
from the client side, so that they would save changes to the database.

The Server.kt is a RESTful server that utilizes a gradle project build script, the Netty framework, and JAX-RS. JSON conversion is
done in my client code, which encodes objects into JSON and sends the information to be processed by the server. Once the JSON
has been recieved server side, it will then be converted back into a useful Object, or it will be processed in some other way.
Once this is done, depending on the task at hand, the server code will call a function from the other team members database API.
